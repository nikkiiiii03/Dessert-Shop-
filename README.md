# Dessert Shop
My game is a restaurant management simulation set in a cozy dessert shop. The shop offers four types of desserts: croissant, bagel, donut, and cake. Each dessert is available in three flavors—chocolate, strawberry, and cream—with cream as the default flavor if none is specified during ordering.

Players begin the game by selecting a mode:
Mode 1: Start accepting customer orders
Mode 2: Close the shop and end the game
Mode 3: View the current dessert menu

At the beginning of each session, players set the inventory for the day. As customers place orders, the system updates and displays the remaining stock. If a customer repeatedly requests a dessert that is not on the menu—three times—the staff will be asked whether to add it. If approved, the dessert will be added to the shop’s offerings in the next round, with all three standard flavor options included.

If the staff chooses not to add the dessert, the count of customer requests for that specific dessert will be reset. This means the system will only ask again if that dessert is requested three more times in the future.

This dynamic system encourages adaptation and menu expansion, offering a fun and interactive way to manage stock, satisfy customers, and grow your dessert business.
